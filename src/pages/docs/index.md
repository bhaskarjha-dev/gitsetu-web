# Introduction to GitSetu

**The enterprise Zero-Dependency orchestration engine for dynamic Git identity and credential isolation.**

GitSetu completely reimagines developer identity security. Operating purely as a localized configuration compiler, it completely eliminates the human error associated with managing multiple identities across isolated workspaces, enterprise repositories, and open-source contributions. 

By unifying automated multi-key generation, native credential helper integration, and hardware signature validation into a single workflow, GitSetu establishes an impenetrable Zero-Trust boundary around your local source code environments.

## The Identity Crisis: What We Solve

Modern developer environments are highly fragmented. Context-switching between distinct organizations creates massive risk surfaces that traditional Git setups simply fail to protect against.

| The Operational Vulnerability | Typical Failure Mode | The GitSetu Automated Engine |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 🔴 **Corporate Identity Leaks** | Committing private proprietary code using a personal email address or public alias. | **Directory-Scoped `includeIf` Interception:** Dynamically swaps active user configuration based on absolute working paths mid-flight. |
| 🔴 **Silent Authentication Collisions** | Single SSH keys loaded globally against overlapping multi-tenant remote hosts (e.g., `github.com`). | **Dedicated Zero-Trust Key generation:** Bootstraps pure, isolated `ed25519` keypairs namespaced exactly to each workspace profile. |
| 🔴 **Cross-Profile PAT Pollution** | HTTPS pull/push streams blindly pulling cached global tokens from OS credentials, returning `HTTP 403 Forbidden`. | **Native Namespaced Credential Broker:** Wraps authentication layers to securely proxy PATs directly via `security` / `secret-tool` keychains. |
| 🔴 **Untracked Historical Config Drift** | Manual one-off edits to global `.gitconfig` files drifting out of compliance over time. | **Idempotent Managed Blocks Protocol:** Stateful compiler that surgically orchestrates local config structures without overwriting global blocks. |
| 🔴 **Pre-Flight Failure Vulnerability** | Forgetting to execute environment prep scripts before pushing code to protected branches. | **Fail-Closed Identity Guard:** Enforces inline verification during pre-commit phases, aborting instantly if config integrity diverges. |

## Architectural Distinctions

### Indistinguishable from Magic: The Native Clone
Competitor tools require developers to memorize custom SSH host aliases (e.g., `git clone git@github-work:org/repo.git`). GitSetu rejects this sub-optimal design pattern. 

By injecting customized `core.sshCommand` configurations conditionally during path evaluation, GitSetu natively intercepts connections *before* outbound sockets initialize. Developers clone, pull, and push normally (`git clone git@github.com:org/repo.git`), while GitSetu silently attaches the exact keypair required by the target directory.

### Absolute Zero Dependencies
Enterprise compliance frameworks frequently prohibit downloading untrusted runtime dependencies onto production machines or secure CI/CD runners. 

GitSetu is written purely in hardened, POSIX-compliant **Bash 3.2**. It requires no Go binaries, no Node runtime engines, no Python virtual environments, and no Rust toolchains. It relies strictly on `bash`, `git`, and `ssh-keygen`—core standard binaries guaranteed to exist natively on every developer workstation and CI environment.

### Fail-Closed Zero-Trust Guard Rails
GitSetu operates on the principle of maximum defensiveness. With options like `useConfigOnly = true` baked into its managed layout protocols, Git natively raises fatal execution errors inside unmapped folders, ensuring code cannot leave your machine unless an authenticated identity profile has explicitly claimed authority over that directory path.
